    <p>
    3. Additional Terms and Conditions. Additional terms and conditions may
    apply to specific portions of or products on the Site or your membership,
    which terms are made part of these Terms of Use by reference. You agree
    to abide by such other terms and conditions. If there is a conflict between
    these Terms of Use and the terms posted or emailed for, or applicable to,
    a specific portion of or products on the Site or your membership, the latter
    terms shall control with respect to your use of that portion of the Site, the
    products or your membership.
    </p>

    <p>
    The following terms and conditions apply to the applicable features on the
    Site:
    </p>

    <p>
    (a) Membership Rewards. On shipment of each Qualifying Order
    (defined below) your account will be credited with a reward of ten dollars
    ($10.00 USD) or such other amount as may be posted from time to time
    (the "Reward"). A "Qualifying Order" means the first order for merchandise
    on the Site placed by an individual whom you sponsored or to whom you
    sent an email invitation to join the Site. Rewards may be redeemed only
    for the purchase of merchandise on the Site and may not be used for
    the purchase of gift cards or services. Rewards are not transferable and
    may not be combined with Rewards belonging to others. At no time may
    you purchase, sell or barter any Rewards. Rewards have no cash value.
    They are promotional in nature and are issued without any exchange of
    money or value from you. As such, Rewards do not constitute property
    and you do not have a vested property right or interest in the Rewards.
    We will notify you when any Rewards are posted to your account. At our
    option, Rewards may expire eighteen months after the date of issuance.
    We reserve the right at any time in our discretion, and without prior
    notice, to discontinue the Rewards program or to add or change Rewards
    program rules, terms or conditions, including changing expiration periods
    or Rewards values for existing or future Rewards credits.
    </p>

    <p>
    (b) Vouchers. We offer a service on the Site pursuant to which third party
    sellers of goods, services and/or experiences ("Merchants") present offers
    ("Offers") for you to purchase vouchers ("Vouchers") redeemable for
    Merchant goods, services and/or experiences. Vouchers are subject to the
    limitations described in each Offer at the time of purchase of the Voucher.
    Without limiting the foregoing, all Vouchers are subject to the additional
    terms and conditions found thereon as well as all terms and conditions
    herein. The specific terms of each Voucher will control in the event of any
    conflicting terms contained herein, unless prohibited by law. By purchasing
    a Voucher, you indicate your acceptance of all of the terms and conditions
    applicable to such Voucher, as set forth in the Offer, on the Voucher, and
    herein.
    </p>

    <p>
    Generally, there are two types of Vouchers that are sold by Merchants,
    a "Specified Offer" Voucher and a "Specified Dollar" Voucher. A Specified
    Offer Voucher means that the product, service or experience is easily
    identified within the terms of the Offer. For example, an Offer for a hot
    stone massage worth $100 that can be purchased for $50. A "Specified
    Dollar" Voucher means that the product, service or experience is not easily
    identifiable within the terms of the Offer such that the Member has the
    ability to choose such products, services or experiences to be redeemed
    from the Merchant. For example, an Offer for $50 of merchandise at
    a specific retail store that can be purchased for $25. A Specified Offer
    Voucher and a Specified Dollar Voucher are collectively referred to as the
    Voucher. The Voucher will indicate which type of Voucher you purchased
    from the Merchant.
    </p>

    <p>
    Vouchers are void to the extent prohibited by law. Each Voucher may be
    used only once, unless prohibited by law. Swet Nation is not responsible
    for lost or stolen Vouchers or Voucher reference numbers. Vouchers
    cannot be combined with any other vouchers, third party certificates,
    coupons, or promotions, unless otherwise specified by Merchant.
    Reproduction, modification, sale or trade of the Voucher is prohibited
    unless done so in compliance with applicable law. Unless expressly stated
    in an Offer or on a Voucher, sales tax which may be due on any goods,
    services and/or experiences you receive is not included. The Merchant
    is obligated to honor the Voucher in compliance with all applicable laws.
    Without limiting the foregoing, use of a Voucher for alcoholic beverages is
    at the sole discretion of the Merchant and is subject to compliance with all
    applicable laws. Swet Nation is not responsible for the redemption of the
    Voucher.
    </p>

    <p>
    Each Specified Dollar Voucher includes two separate portions: (1) a paid
    portion amount which is equal to the amount your credit card is charged
    for the Voucher (the "Paid Portion"), and (2) a promotional portion amount
    which is provided at no additional cost to you and which is equal to the
    difference between the total initial value of the Voucher and the Paid
    Portion (the "Promotional Portion"). The Promotional Portion must be used
    the first time the Voucher is used, and any unused Promotional Portion
    value remaining after the first transaction will be forfeited and cannot be
    redeemed for cash. In addition the Promotional Portion must be used by
    the expiration date printed on the Voucher for the Promotional Portion,
    which may be a different expiration date than for the Paid Portion. If you
    redeem your Voucher for less than the full amount stated on the Voucher,
    your purchase will be allocated first against the Paid Portion until the
    balance of the Paid Portion is $0.00, and then against the Promotional
    Portion value. If the expiration of the Paid Portion is prohibited under
    applicable law, then the Voucher shall expire as follows: the Promotional
    Portion of the Voucher will expire on the date printed on the Voucher, and
    the Paid Portion of the Voucher will expire on the later of (i) five (5) years
    from the date the Voucher is issued or (ii) the date required by applicable
    law. Unless otherwise required by law, Vouchers have no cash value.
    </p>

    <p>
    Cash back will be issued for partial redemption of the Paid Portion of any
    Voucher to the extent required by law. To the extent that a Merchant is
    required by law to provide cash back for partial redemptions of the Paid
    Portion of any Specified Dollar Voucher, the amount of the cash back you
    would be entitled to receive is equal to the difference between the Paid
    Portion and the amount you redeemed. For example, if you purchased a
    $50.00 Voucher for $25.00 (Paid Portion) and only redeemed $20.00 worth
    of goods or services from the Merchant, you would be entitled to cash back
    of $5. Likewise, if you redeemed your Specified Dollar Voucher for $30.00
    worth of goods or services from the Merchant, you would not be entitled
    to any cash back since the amount you redeemed ($30) is greater than
    the Paid Portion ($25). No cash back or credit will be issued for partial
    redemption of the Promotional Portion of any Specified Dollar Voucher,
    unless required by law.
    </p>

    <p>
    A Specified Offer Voucher does not have two separate portions. A
    Specified Offer Voucher will expire in full as of the expiration date indicated
    on such Voucher, unless required by law. A Specified Offer Voucher has
    no cash value and no cash back will be issued, unless required by law.
    </p>

    <p>
    The Merchant is the seller of the goods, services and/or experiences in
    which you purchase, and is the seller, issuer and obligor of the Voucher.
    </p>

    <p>
    As such, the Merchant shall be fully responsible for any and all loss or
    damage of any kind, including personal injury or death, (whether in tort,
    contract, or strict liability) arising out of or related to your redemption or
    attempted redemption, in whole or in part, of any Voucher. You waive
    and release Swet Nation, its parent, subsidiaries and affiliates, and their
    respective officers, directors, employees, agents, successors, subsidiaries,
    divisions, distributors, suppliers, affiliates and third parties from any
    liability for any damages or losses arising out of or otherwise incurred in
    connection with your redemption or attempted redemption, in whole or in
    part, of any Voucher.
    </p>

    <p>
    Swet Nation is solely the marketing portal for the Merchant. If you have
    problems with the Voucher or the goods, services and/or experiences
    provided, or to be provided, in connection with the Voucher, we will use
    reasonable efforts to assist you in dealing with the Merchant. However, we
    cannot and do not guarantee the issuance of any credits and/or refunds.
    Any attempted redemption of any Voucher not consistent with these
    terms and conditions will render the Voucher null and void. Resale of the
    Voucher or use for unauthorized advertising, marketing, sweepstakes or
    other promotional purposes is strictly prohibited. Vouchers are subject to
    verification and are void if not obtained in accordance with these terms and
    conditions and through legitimate channels.
    </p>

    <p>
    SWET NATION MAKES NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
    WITH RESPECT TO VOUCHERS, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION,
    ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR
    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. IN THE EVENT A VOUCHER
    CODE IS NON-FUNCTIONAL, YOUR SOLE REMEDY, AND OUR SOLE
    LIABILITY, SHALL BE THE REPLACEMENT OF SUCH VOUCHER.
    CERTAIN STATE LAWS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON IMPLIED
    WARRANTIES OR THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN
    DAMAGES. IF THESE LAWS APPLY TO YOU, SOME OR ALL OF
    THE ABOVE DISCLAIMERS, EXCLUSIONS, OR LIMITATIONS MAY
    NOT APPLY TO YOU, AND YOU MIGHT HAVE ADDITIONAL RIGHTS.
    THE RISK OF LOSS AND TITLE FOR VOUCHERS PASS TO THE
    PURCHASER UPON OUR ELECTRONIC OR OTHER TRANSMISSION
    TO THE RECIPIENT, WHICHEVER IS APPLICABLE. IN NO EVENT WILL
    SWET NATION BE LIABLE FOR ANY PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
    OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES.
    </p>

    <p>
    This Section 3(b) applies only to the Voucher service and no other service
    or part of the Site.
    </p>

    <p>
    (c) Return Credit. Items that have been returned for a Swet Nation
    merchandise credit will be refunded in the form of a merchandise credit
    (a "Merchandise Credit") at the original purchase price, plus applicable
    sales tax, and, if applicable, the return shipping charges will be deducted
    from the amount of the Merchandise Credit. Merchandise Credit may be
    redeemed only for the purchase of merchandise on the Site and may not
    be used for the purchase of gift cards or services. Merchandise Credit
    is not transferable and may not be combined with Merchandise Credit
    belonging to others. At no time may you purchase, sell or barter any
    Merchandise Credit. Merchandise Credit is not redeemable for cash,
    unless required by law. The obligations represented by outstanding
    Merchandise Credit may at any time be assigned to and assumed by any
    affiliate of, or successor to, the present or any future owner of the Swet
    Nation website, or any third party under contract with such present or
    future owner. You, as a Member, expressly consent to and authorize any
    such future assignment and assumption of outstanding Merchandise Credit
    obligations, and you agree to look solely to such assignee in the event of
    any such transfer.
    </p>

    <p>
    (d) Return Refund. Items that have been returned for a refund to your
    original form of payment will be refunded (a "Return Refund") at the
    original purchase price plus applicable sales tax and the return shipping
    charges (if any) will be deducted from your refund. Please note that in
    connection with the Return Refund, a refund to your original form of
    payment includes restoring any prior Merchandise Credit or Membership
    Rewards that you may have used for your purchase to your Swet Nation
    Member account. Refunds to your original form of payment will appear on
    your statement within seven days.
    </p>

    <p>
    (e) Credit Balances. Any credit balance (including a Reward balance and/
    or Merchandise Credit) will be automatically applied to your next purchase
    of merchandise from the Site and the order of redemption of such credits
    will be determined by Swet Nation. To the extent your credits exceed the
    amount of your total purchase, the excess credit balance will remain in
    your account to be applied to your next purchase, subject to the foregoing
    terms and conditions. If your account and/or membership is terminated for
    any reason, any credit balances in your account may be cancelled, except
    as prohibited by law. Account balances are determined by Swet Nation
    and such determination is final.
    </p>

    <p>
    (f) Text Messages. If you provided us with your mobile phone number, you
    must have a text messaging-enabled mobile device with a text messaging
    plan in order to receive text messages from us. This service is free from
    Swet Nation but charges from your carrier for usage may apply and you
    are responsible for all such charges.
    </p>

    <p>
    (g) Member Email and Postings. The Site may provide Members with
    the ability to send email messages to others and to post messages on
    the Site. You are solely responsible for your account, password, profile,
    messages, notes, text, information, opinions, ideas and any other content
    you post, upload, submit, publish, or display (hereinafter "post") on or

    the "Member Content"). Any Member Content that is posted will not be
    treated as confidential. Swet Nation has the right but not the obligation to
    monitor and decline, edit, or remove (without notice) all or any portion of

    at any time, in its sole discretion, to monitor Member Content, it still has
    no responsibility for the Member Content or for the conduct of the Member
    posting Member Content or to edit or remove any Member Content, except
    in compliance with Section 14 below. If you are involved in a dispute with
    one or more Members of Swet Nation, you release Swet Nation (including
    its officers, directors, affiliates, and employees) from claims, demands, and

    works, such Member Content, and to grant and authorize sublicenses
    of the foregoing. You represent and warrant that you will not provide
    any Member Content to which you do not have the full right to grant the
    license specified in this Section 3(f). You waive all moral rights in the

    must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA.

    15. Choice of Law and Forum. These Terms of Use and any dispute of
    any sort that might arise between you and Swet Nation or its parent,
    subsidiaries, divisions, or affiliates shall be governed by and construed
    in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,
    without regard to its conflict of law principles, as it is applied to agreements
    entered into and performed therein, and excluding the United Nations
    Convention on Contracts for the Sale of Goods, as amended from time
    to time. Any action brought to enforce this Agreement or matters related
    to the Site will be brought in either the state or federal courts in Boston,
    Massachusetts; provided, however, that notwithstanding anything
    contained in these Terms of Use to the contrary, we shall have the right
    to institute judicial proceedings against you or anyone acting by, through
    </p>

    <p>
    or under you, in order to enforce our rights hereunder through reformation
    of contract, specific performance, injunction or similar equitable relief.
    You consent to the jurisdiction of such courts and irrevocably waive any
    objection, including without limitation any objection to the laying of venue
    or based on the grounds of forum non convenience, which you may now
    or hereafter have to the bringing of any such action or proceeding in such
    jurisdiction. In addition, you expressly waive any right to a jury trial in any
    legal proceeding against Swet Nation, its parent, subsidiaries, divisions,
    or affiliates or their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, or
    successors under or related to these Terms of Use. Any claim or cause of
    action you have with respect to use of the Site must be commenced within
    one (1) year after the claim arises.

    16. Miscellaneous. Unless otherwise specified herein, these Terms of
    Use, together with the Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement
    between you and Swet Nation with respect to the Site and supersede all
    prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals (whether oral,
    written or electronic) between you and Swet Nation with respect to the
    Site. If any part of these Terms of Use is held invalid or unenforceable, that
    portion shall be construed in a manner consistent with applicable law to
    reflect, as nearly as possible, the original intentions of the parties, and the
    remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect. The failure of Swet
    Nation to act with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive
    Swet Nation's right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches.
    Swet Nation's failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these
    Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. These
    Terms of Use, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not
    be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Swet Nation
    without restriction. The section headings contained in these Terms of Use
    are included for convenience only and shall not limit or otherwise affect the
    terms of these Terms of Use.
