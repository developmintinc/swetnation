			        Swet Nation was created for athletes by athletes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We understand the importance of staying healthy, fit and active while also realizing that doing so can be extremely costly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our mission is to offer the best solution for sports enthusiasts, performance athletes and the every day person to purchase high quality athletic products at the lowest possible prices while also allowing our members to discover and experience new amazing athletic brands.

                <p>
                    The bottom line: to provide a no SWET shopping experience.
