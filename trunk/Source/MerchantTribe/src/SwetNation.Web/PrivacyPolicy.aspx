    <strong>How We Protect Your Information</strong> 
    <p>
    We are committed to protecting the information we receive from you. We
    follow reasonable technical and management practices to help protect the
    confidentiality, security and integrity of data stored on our system. While
    no computer system is completely secure, we believe the measures we
    have implemented reduce the likelihood of security problems to a level
    appropriate to the type of data involved.
    </p>

    <p>
    The Site encrypts your credit card number and other personal information
    using secure socket layer (SSL) technology to provide for the secure
    transmission of the information from your PC to our servers. In addition,
    only those employees and third parties who need access to your
    information in order to perform their duties are allowed such access.
    </p>

    <strong>Accessing and Updating Your Personal Information and Preferences</strong>

    information and your preferences to receive email or other communications
    from us by sending an email to info@swetnation.com. Please note that
    your friends and contacts may still choose to send email invitations to you.
    Any user who receives an email invitation to join the Site may choose
    not to receive such invitations in the future by following the instructions in
    the email invitations and, in addition, if you are a member, you may also

    <p>
    While we make efforts to accommodate requests to restrict our use of your
    information, we reserve the right to delete all or any portion of customer
    information if we are not able to reasonably accommodate a requested
    restriction.
    </p>
